    <h1>Protective Metrics Blog</h1>

    <p>This is a collection of documents written about <a href="https://protectivemetrics.com">Protective Metrics</a>. Part of my marketing strategy is to build this business in public. The pages here are being created as a type of Digital Garden.</p>

    <p>Some of these pages are just things we're working on at the moment and some of them are more like operating documents. We may organize them accordingly in the future but right now we'll just list everything from newest to oldest.</p>
