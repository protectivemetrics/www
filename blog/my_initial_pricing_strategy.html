    <h1>Initial Pricing Stragegy</h1>

    <p>We plan to start our pricing with the following three tiers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Starter $19 (250k Impressions)</li>
        <li>Business $49 (750k Impressions)</li>
        <li>Enterprise $249 (1m Impressions)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We'll also provide a 1-month extendable free trial. A 14-day trial is almost <em>never</em> long enough to evaluate a product. A 30-day trial is usually enough, but not always. We'd love to offer a much longer trial but keeping it shorter will allow us to learn faster because cancellations are probably a good learning opportunity. So, we're going to offer a 1-month trial but also be flexible and allow it to be extended on request.</p>

    <p>We'd also love to offer a free tier, but that doesn't allow us to learn if this is a viable business or not. We may be able to offer one once we better understand our customers as well as the resource requirements and costs of providing this service.</p>

    <p>We've heard the advice that you should have three prices available. It turns out that most users will select the middle tier. The advice says that the upper tier should be a lot better than the middle tier while the upper tear should be marginally better than the middle. The lower tier is a great option but people tend to pick the middle tier because it's a significant upgrade. A small number of people who are excited about your project and want to support your business will select the higher tier. This initial pricing is based on this concept.</p>

    <p>As a small business, we also need to limit our enterprise tier in order to prevent getting in over our heads at this early stage.</p>

    <p>We took a look at three competitors to help us set an initial price.</p>

    <p>The first competitor is the leading option today. Their offer is free for many people but you pay with the privacy of your users. There have been lots of arguments about weather or not it's possible to meet some of the privacy laws today using this service. Once you get to a certain level the salesman may come calling, as they did in one case we're familiar with. The pricing for enterprise use was extreme, costing over $100k per year. To be fair, we're talking about a lot of data. We don't approve of the business model where you provide something free until a client hits a relatively obscure volume and then charging high fee's once they are entrenched deeply with the product.</p>

    <p>The second competitor seems to be the leading niche provider. They're focused on privacy, just like Protective Metrics is, but they don't go quite as far. They use a hash of the users IP address and their referrer (the website they came from). This hash is reversable only for someone who knows the salt process. The stats provider knows how the data was salted and can likely reverse it. This method allows them to track customers with a fingerprint. Their pricing starts at $9 per month. They have five available tiers at $9, $19, $29, $49, and $69. They also have a sixth "enterprise" tier that requires you to talk to them.</p>

    <p>The third competitor is a lesser known niche provider. They're also focused on privacy and they go a little farther by not logging IP addreses at all. Instead, they have a unique solution to tracking active users. But, we think their solution for visitor tracking is flawed. There are also some studies that suggest a pretty big margin of error for visitor counts across providers. Their pricing is simple with two tiers at $19 and $59 plus steep discounts for annual payments.</p>
