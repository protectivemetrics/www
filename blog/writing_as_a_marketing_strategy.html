    <h1>Writing as a Marketing Strategy</h1>

    <p>I recently woke from a dream where I found myself in a hospital bed near the end of my life. I sat alone and reflected on my regrets. What stood out to me was that I had not achieved my life-long dream of owning a business.</p>
    
    <p>As regrets go this isn't a bad one to have. I hope it's reflective of the types of things I'll really think about in my final days. In the meantime it's a wake-up call to double-down on my business efforts.</p>

    <p>Through my writing I plan to provide insights into the successes and failures of building this business from scratch. By sharing the lessons I learn, I hope to inspire myself and others.</p>

    <p>Writing is an important part of my thought process. It forces me to think through my ideas at a deeper level than reflection alone. I hope it will provide insight that propels me forward and keeps me focused. It will also exist as a journal that I can look back on and learn from.</p>

    <p>I've been writing stray thoughts to my personal blog for more than 20 years. It's exciting to see what others find valuable. And I love getting the rare feedback that something I wrote helped someone. I've seen my past writing generate organic traffic and I hope the same will happen here.</p>
