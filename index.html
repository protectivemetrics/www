    <h2 class="pro">No Cookies</h2>

    <h2 class="pro">No IP Addresses</h2>

    <p>We don't log IP addresses. We believe that capturing an IP, and then obfuscating it, is only a half measure. An IP included in a hash is still a user fingerprint.</p>

    <h2 class="pro">Open Source</h2>

    <p>Protective Metrics is open source and available on GitHub. This allows our users to inspect the software and verify our claims.</p>

    <h2 class="pro">Impressions not Visitors</h2>

    <p>We don't pretend to track unreliable statistics like <em>visitors</em>. Our primary metric is <em>impressions</em>. We believe that relying on visitor statistics can lead to flawed decision making and misguided marketing efforts. Instead, we believe website owners should focus on a variety of metrics, including site traffic, user engagement, conversion rates, and customer feedback to get a more accurate picture of their businesses performance.</p>

    <p>There's no vendor lock-in here. You can download your data at any time. There's also an opportunity to build your own tools for evaluating your data.</p>
